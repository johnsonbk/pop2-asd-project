Precursor projects
##################

CISL's Advanced Research Computing Division `announced that Derecho will be
delayed until June 2022 <https://arc.ucar.edu/articles/170>`_. This could
provide lead time to pursue precursor projects (on a different platform such as
KAUST's `Shaheen II <https://www.hpc.kaust.edu.sa/content/shaheen-ii>`_) to
test various aspects of the experimental setup such as adaptive
inflation and the influence of certain observations such as sea surface
salinity.

Adaptive inflation
==================

An experiment contrasting the behavior of the inverse-gamma adaptive inflation
algorithm of `Gharamti (2019)
<https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/146/2/mwr-d-17-0187.1.xml>`_
in eddy-parameterizing and eddy-resolving ocean models has not been attempted.
Such an experiment would enable the team to test the ASD experimental
configuration over short (model week to month) integration periods.

Sea surface salinity
====================

`Deppenmeier et al. (2021) <https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-20-0217.1>`_ studied
the temperature structure of the Pacific Cold Tongue (PCT). The PCT is adjacent
to the Eastern Tropical Pacific Fresh Pool, yet the influence of salinity on
the structure of the PCT is poorly understood. A/B experiments, in which sea
surface salinity is assimilated and not assimilated could be conducted to gauge
its influence on the predicability of the PCT.
