Overview
========

.. note::

   This project has cleared thie initial proposal stage and the final proposal
   is due prior to January 10, 2022.

According to the full proposal request:

..
  
   Your full proposal should follow the guidelines provided for University ASD
   proposals at `https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/university-asd <https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/university-asd>`_.
   This will be similar to the normal NSC proposal format, with additional
   attention to project readiness, team commitment, and your analysis and data
   management plan. You may omit discussion of strategic relevance since that
   has been assessed in Phases 1 and 2.

   Note that your full proposal should be completed and submitted via the
   `allocation submission site <https://xras-submit.ucar.edu/login>`_.

.. warning::

   The CISL "University ASD" link above was broken when the new CISL website
   was unvieled in December 2021. The guidelines from that now-lost page are
   reproduced below.

Proposal document
=================

Proposals should be five pages or less for Sections A–E below. The data
management plan, accomplishment reports, references, and figures (Sections F–I)
should be an additional five pages or less. The proposal should address each
numbered item; please retain the section and item numbering and order in your
responses.

Note: The request document must identify all PIs and Co-Is on any associated
awards. In addition, the web submission form must include the names and
affiliations of all PIs and Co-Is on the supporting NSF grant(s) and a complete
list of collaborators and their institutions.

A. Project title and PIs
------------------------
On the first page of the ASD proposal document please include the following:

ASD project title
PIs and Co-Is on the supporting NSF award(s) along with their institution
CPU core-hours and/or GPU hours requested
Peak disk space needed

B. Scientific objectives
------------------------

Describe the scientific problem that will be studied and its importance. This
section should include discussion of related work recently completed by the PIs
and other scientists along with supporting references; describe the linkage
between the NSF award(s) and the proposed ASD activity (especially important if
the published NSF award abstract does not clearly describe the computational
component of the work funded or if the work is a “natural extension” of the
funded work).

C. Computational plan
---------------------

Discussion of your planned computational experiments and the resources needed
should comprise the bulk of the five-page proposal.

Describe the numerical approach or models to be used. (For a non-standard or
non-community model, the numerical description should briefly describe the
approximations and other methods proposed to obtain valid solutions to the
problem.)

Describe the computational experiments being proposed and how they relate to
the scientific objectives in sufficient detail for reviewers to confirm the
estimate of system resources required.

Describe the number of CPU core-hours and/or GPU hours required for each
proposed experiment and the total resources for the request, including the
total data written to disk, sufficient for reviewers to assess the
appropriateness and efficiency of the data management plan. Explain how the
number of core-hours per simulated year was determined.

Provide a table summarizing the number of CPU core-hours, GPU hours, and
storage space required for each experimental configuration and the total for
the proposed set of computational experiments.

D. Code requirements and readiness
----------------------------------

The reviewers will use this section to assess the readiness of the code to run
successfully and efficiently as soon as Derecho becomes available.

Describe the model or code to be used in a few sentences, including an
assessment of its current readiness to run on Derecho. Please include the name
of the model or code. You may cite a web page where the model or code is
described.

Describe your proposed project's special programming or runtime environment
requirements. For example, required software, libraries, wall-clock time,
scratch disk space needs, particularly if they differ significantly from what
is currently available by default on Cheyenne today.

Benchmarks and scalability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Benchmarking system and results: Please summarize benchmark details or
reference web page. Describe the model or code’s scalability on current systems
and estimate the maximum number of Derecho nodes that could be used
efficiently.

Other special requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

E. Data analysis and visualization
----------------------------------

ASD projects may be granted allocations on the Casper cluster in addition to
Derecho allocations. CISL will provide help in constructing visualizations to
improve understanding and presentation of results. Please describe plans or
estimated needs for data analysis and visualization resources following the ASD
project period on Derecho.

Supporting information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sections F–I together should be an additional five pages or less.

F. Data management plan
-----------------------

Because of the potential for large-scale Derecho projects to produce extensive
data output, the project’s short-term disk storage needs and the ASD project
data targeted for longer-term storage should be described in Section C. The
Data Management Plan should be used to provide additional explanation of the
project’s data needs and plans.

Disk space
~~~~~~~~~~

Describe the project’s medium-term disk needs for data analysis and
visualization following completion of the primary HPC runs through the
submission of the final report in March 2023.

Storage space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NCAR will provide storage space, commensurate with review panel
recommendations, for up to one year after the ASD project ends. Describe any
longer-term storage needs and/or relevant plans for sharing or managing the
resulting data over the longer term.

Offsite data transfer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Discuss the amount of data to be transferred to another center and the
frequency of transfers.

G. Accomplishment report on prior large allocations
---------------------------------------------------

The reviewers will use the accomplishment report to judge the proposing team’s
experience with large-scale computations and their likelihood of ASD success on
Derecho. The accomplishment report should focus on research in the past five
years conducted with large (merit-reviewed) computing allocations at NCAR or
other HPC centers. In addition to summarizing the computational experiments and
scientific outcomes, the accomplishment report should note

(a) the scientific publications produced,
(b) the number of graduate students that worked on each large allocation project,
(c) the theses produced, if any.

H. References
-------------

Please limit references to those directly related to the proposed project.

I. Figures and captions
-----------------------

Optional. Figures may be embedded within the first five pages of the proposal
document; however, embedded figures will count against the five-page limit.
